# Sort Search 

Aim:

> Learn some rust. Revisit some elementary algorithms.

Goals: 

* Implement a number of sort and search algorithms.
* Integrate functionality into a CLI tool.
* Create docs, tests and benchmarks for these. 

## TODOs 

1. Write two more sort algorithms 
2. Implement benchmarking
3. Add docs 
4. Make error handling coherent
5. Move from `usize` to numeric
